<H1 align="center">Social Media Integration</H1>
Integrating social media logins means using APIs for each corresponding social platform, like Facebook Login and Google+ API. While some APIs limit the resources that third-party apps can use without paying, it’s typically free to use these APIs and support a range of social logins.

◇Create a mobile app, where user can login through at least two social media from such as Facebook and Google.
◇ After login, display all the details (e.g. Name, profile photo, email, etc.) on the second page.
◇ Take help of online tutorials and Youtube videos.
◇ No backend / server side programming required.
◇ Very good looking UI and responsive UI, which should work for mobiles as well as tablets.
◇ Clean code is a must.
